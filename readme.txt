DESCRIPTION:
 The shear resulting from internal wave reflections can play a crucial role
 in the transport and resuspension of sediments in oceanic conditions. In 
 particular, when these waves undergo a critical reflection phenomenon, the 
 reflected wave can produce a very large shear. Separating the reflected 
 wave from the incident wave is a technical challenge since the two waves 
 share the same temporal frequency. In our study, we present a series of 
 experimental measurements of internal waves in critical reflection 
 configuration and we analyze them using the 2D-VMD-prox decomposition method. 
 This decomposition method was adapted to specifically decompose waves in 
 an internal wave critical reflection, showing an improvement in its 
 performance with respect to preexisting internal wave decomposition methods. 
 Being able to confidently isolate the reflected wave allowed us to compare 
 our results to a viscous and non-linear model for critical reflection, 
 that correctly describes the dependence of the shear rate produced in the 
 boundary as a function of the experimental parameters.
